## About

This is a solution to Kaggle's Flavours of Physics: Finding τ → μμμ [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics).

## Requirements

I've used python 3.6.1 for this project. Requirements can be found in the requirements.txt file.

If you run into problems installing xgboost, I recommend having a look at the [installation guide](http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html).

## Datasets

As the datasets are quite large, I did not include them in this folder. They can be obtained from the [Data tab](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics/data) in the competition's page.

The notebook code assumes that the following files in the data folder are present:

* training.csv
* test.csv
* check_agreement.csv
* check_correlation.csv

## Code

I have used the code provided in the [starter kit](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics#starter-kit) to verify my results. The notebook code assumes that the following file is present in the flavours-of-physics-start folder:

* evaluation.py
