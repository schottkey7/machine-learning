## Proposal
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Domain Background
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

_In this section, provide brief details on the background information of the domain from which the project is proposed. Historical information relevant to the project should be included. It should be clear how or why a problem in the domain can or should be solved. Related academic research should be appropriately cited in this section, including why that research is relevant. Additionally, a discussion of your personal motivation for investigating a particular problem in the domain is encouraged but not required._

I have chosen to complete the "Flavours of Physics: Finding τ → μμμ" kaggle competition as my capstone project. The competition's description and formulation can be found at [its kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics). My motivation for picking this problem is two-fold: I have a deep interest in physics and would be very interested in bridging the gap between my physics and machine learning knowledge; and I believe this research is of great importance as it has the potential to challenge our current understanding.

The [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) (SM) of physics is our most successful theoretical framework but it fails to exlain some important observed phenomena, such as matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe or the structure of generations of elementary particles. Moreover, it does not predict the existence of dark matter or describes quantum gravity. However, SM, does not point to any new unexplored areas which we can explore in order to find answers to these questions. One such way is to find violations of symmetries that are widely believed to be conserved and are intrinsic to the structure of SM. One such symmetry around which this problem revolves is [lepton flavour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavour_(particle_physics)). If significant signal for decays which do not conserve lepton flavour is found in the dataset, it would challenge the assumptions of the SM. 



### Problem Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

_In this section, clearly describe the problem that is to be solved. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once)._

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

_In this section, the dataset(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem._

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

_In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once)._

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

_In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail._

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

_In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms)._

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

_In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project._
